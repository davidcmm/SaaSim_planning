*** 3 - What is SaaSim? ***

SaaSim is a simulator based on Cloud Computing market, where companies provide
virtual resources on-demand, such as infrastructure, data storage and software services. 
SaaSim aims to simulate the behavior of a SaaS provider dealing with planning 
and management capacity of a SaaS application. The simulator has two main parts: i) the simulation of
a capacity planning process where reservation plans are established between the SaaS provider and a IaaS provider; ii) 
the simulation of workload requests processing. In this phase a dynamic provisioning system is considered in order to
calculate the number of machines required to process the workload.


*** 4 - Building ***

On a terminal window run:

	mvn package

and a target/saasim-${version}-all.zip file will be created.

*** 5 - Configuring ***

SaaSim need some configuration files to work, 
	** config.properties : contains the basic informations to SaaSim work, like the 
planning heuristic, machine type to be used by an Overprovisioning planning heuristic, provisioning heuristic, workload parser, and others. 
Also, this file include all files necessary to SaaSim: saas.plans, saas.app, users.properties, 
iaas.providers, model.plan ;
	** saas.plans : contains values of plans offered by a SaaS provider (currently values are based on Big Commerce). Informations 
like the plan name(bronze, gold, etc), price, limits of cpu, storage, and others.
	** saas.app : contains information about the application, like number of tiers, expected response time, etc.
	** users.properties : contains information about SaaS client(s) submiting requests to a SaaS provider. This file points to a set of *.trc files that represents the whole workload of each SaaS client during the evaluation period (e.g., one year). A *.trc file contain a line for each day to be simulated, and each line points to a file that represents a day of workload.
	** model.plan : contains information about the reservation plan established (provider name, machine types, amounts reserved).
	** iaas.providers : contains information about the IaaS providers. 

*** 6 - Running ***

On the terminal window run
 
	runSimulation.sh 

with one configuration file like config.properties and SaaSim will be run. The script will run a capacity planning phase
